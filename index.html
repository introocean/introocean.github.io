<p>Robert Stewart's "Introduction to Physical Oceanography" was the
first oceanography textbook for many students. It was always the free
high-quality source of basic oceanographic knowledge. Robert Stewart
retired in 2009 and did not update the book after that. With his
permission, we now publish the latest version of the book's LaTeX
source code on GitHub. Dr. Stewart gives his permission to update the
book by fixing errors and adding new information. He has only two
conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don't let the book grow into an encyclopedia. It is an
INTRODUCTION, leaving details to more expert and focused publications
(which could also be on the web server). Keep the book focused on the
most important issues students need to know about. Today, satellite
oceanography needs to be emphasized as most of our knowledge comes
from satellites and drifters.</p>

<p>My only request is that the book not be offered for sale. It should
be open source and available to everyone at no cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are going to update the book through the usual GitHub procedure
with PRs and code review. Any help and contributions from the
oceanographic community will be greatly appreciated.</p>
